# 🧠 Neural Networks Project

This project implements and compares **two neural networks** for geometric shape recognition on 10×10 input matrices.

## 📚 Overview
- **NN-One.py:** Neural network with one hidden layer  
- **NN-Two.py:** Neural network with two hidden layers  
- **Our_Data.py:** Script generating input matrices for training/testing  
- **Neural Networks.pdf:** Project report including explanations, architecture, and results.

## 🧩 How It Works
The goal of this project is to recognize geometric shapes:
- Circle  
- Ellipse  
- Triangle  

Each network was trained both **sequentially** and **randomly**, and results were compared in terms of accuracy and learning speed.

## ⚙️ Running the Project
```bash
python NN-One.py
python NN-Two.py
